# Calculator
We made it to the final project for Foundations. Since this is the final project, I'm going to try to make it look nice. I'm going to use this project to make freshen up my css, and keep practicing js. The plan is always the same divide and take it step by step.


I'm putting a pin in this project for now. There are things that it needs to do. And I think that if I move on and come back to it maybe it'll be easier to solve, and maybe I'll see things clearer.

The functions that my program needs is to be 1) able to calculate operations with multiple operators, 2) it needs to be able to calculate functions in pairs ie, 12 + 5 - 6 * 4, needs to run (12+5) get the answer - 6, get that answer * 4. 3) The last major problem that my calculator needs is to round decimals. Which I don't think would be hard to do. Keyboard support and making the calculator pretty are the extras that I'd be proud to add in this program. I'm going to leave this project for now but hope to comeback to it soon.
